introtext: If you would like to find out more please click the ‘Free Quote’ button and give us an idea what you are looking for. We can get you a quick idea of the cost and give you a walk through on the options for you and your family. The process can take some time given how many people are involved occasionally but we strive to make it an easy process on our end no matter what the situation. We do all the production in house giving us the power to be much more timely on delivery than anyone else in the industry. Any changes are done right away and in house so you can be sure the order will be fulfilled as fast as possible. We pride ourselves on offering the best service to get you exactly what you want on time.

      <h3>Memorial Orders</h3><p> usually take anywhere from 1-2 weeks to 2-3 months just depending on art approval and if it is a custom stone order or we have it in stock. If the stone you prefer is in stock, it just depends on how fast decisions can be made regarding art approval. We take your ideas given to us either through email or over the phone and do a digital mock up, there are usually a few options to choose from with choices regarding fonts, images, placement and borders. This is emailed to you which you can then send around to family members to help in the decision making process if needed. We do have a gallery to look at for ideas on Facebook. (link) There may be some email exchanges about changes, then once a choice has been made and art is then confirmed with us we move the order into production. The mask is cut usually within a few days and applied to the stone. (if the stone is a custom order, timing will be given as to when the stone may arrive. The process will then be on hold until we receive the stone) The sandblasting is then done and the stone will be painted at the same time if required. From the time of art approval generally it takes a week for a stone to be done and ready for delivery or pick up.</p>
      <h3>Address Stone Orders</h3><p> are usually done within 1-2 weeks. Orders are taken over email or phone for what you would like. We need a straight on picture of the stone to be sandblasted with a height and width measurement. We then superimpose the text and images on top of the photo so you can get an idea of the size and look of the piece. Changes can be made and when a decision is reached the mask is the cut. A date is then set when it would be convenient for our team to come to your property to do the sandblasting. The process does not disturb anything on your property as we tent and tarp the entire area and collect all the sand after as we reuse it. You are welcome to watch or stay while we do the job, people often are interested in watching the process although it is very loud.</p>
      <h3>On-site Headstone Additions</h3><p> are much the same as an address stone in that we need a straight on picture of the monument as well as the height of the text and the spacing in between to be able to match it. The same process is then done with a digital proof and setting a date for the job to be completed but it is with the cemetery caretaker and we look after that. A picture of the fished job is then sent.</p>

      <h3>LASER ENGRAVING:</h3><p> This process is a laser machine vaporizing material ‘out’ of an area. Used for any material that won’t melt when heat treated and is a very precise method of marking almost anything. It is done with digital art printed through a laser engraver. </p>
      <h3>ROTARY ENGRAVING:</h3><p> We also do rotary engraving with a router type engraver printed digitally through a routering program using different bits to router ‘out’ material. This process is used for anything that can’t be heat treated on a laser or is too thick or cant be cut with a laser. ie: metal </p>
      <h3>SANDBLASTING:</h3><p> This process is done by hand with a blast gun shooting compressed air and blasting medium through a hose at an object that has been covered with rubber mask with the exposed parts being ‘blasted’ out by the sand. </p>
      </p>
      <h2>Physical Process: </h2>
      <h3>Sandblasting:</h3><p> First we draw the art digitally in an art program which we use for the proofing process as well so customers can see exactly what the art will look like. We then cut out the mask digitally on the laser and ‘weed’ out the parts that are to be recessed. After measuring and marking where the mask will go on the product we then peel the back of the mask to expose the adhesive baking and stick it on. Every part of the product has to be taped using a protective rubber tape so it doesn’t receive any wear from the excess material moving at high speeds in the booth. A blast gun is used to shoot abrasive material and compressed air at very high speed at the object and the places that are exposed are ‘blasted’ out and the rest of the ‘sand’ bounces off the rubber and tape where it is not to be marked. We minimize dust by blasting in a tent with a dust collection system when we are on-site to avoid any excess dust on the property along with tarps and boards to not disturb the ground in any way. There is a dust collection system installed to collect the dust when we are blasting in-house as well. The on-site process takes about 1 hour given no issues for one stone. 
      </p>
      <h3>Laser Engraving:</h3><p> The easy way to understand the laser engraving process is, it’s just like printing on a regular printer but instead of different inks, you print with percentage of power (100% of the whatever power your laser is), speed (that the printhead travels at) and frequency (the amount of times the laser shoots per second). This is all determined by the percentage of black in a picture so everything has to be printed in greyscale. Instead of paper you can put just about anything in the machine! We print on metal, plastic, glass, stone, wood, rubber, fabric, foam, paper, ceramic, fiberglass or pretty much anything you can think of. We have even done cookies, apples and bananas and of course pumpkins at Halloween! We set up the art digitally in an art program which is printed to a driver that controls the engraver. The laser is produced from a CO2 cartridge turning through a series of mirrors and lenses to essentially vaporize the material its being printed on. The laser head does not actually touch the material so it does not have to be taped or held down in any way other than if it will be displaced by the suction of the exhaust flowing through the machine. You can very easily burn something with a laser if you have either the wrong settings or you don’t know what you are doing. You also need to know where the laser is going to land since you have a large table and different sized objects on it so almost everything has to be test printed before running the real job. There are 2 different types of laser engraving as well, there is ‘raster engraving’ where the head travels back and forth on one plane on the x-axis as it is focused to the material very accurately and takes out blocks of material. The other is ‘vector cutting’ which is where the head travels on one plane but a combination of x and y axis travel allowing it to cut in all directions. The timing for any different job is very different when lasering depending on the material. For a typical order to be done we try to process them in a week. If there are any issues with materials or other factors you will be notified. 
      </p>
      <h3> 
      Rotary Engraving:</h3><p> This utilizes different cutting bits to literally carve out material and is known as the ‘old’ way of engraving but still very useful in some instances. The art is set up through a digital art program but specific to the routering format. Material is laid out on a table but has to be held in place either by a jig, tape or vice so it doesn’t move when the bit touches it. The bits come in different sizes and materials so there are many of them. The different bit sizes will give you a different line width depending on the pressure you apply downward on the bit. You can also set the speed the head travels at and the spindle RPM for harder or softer materials and to finish edges in a certain way. We use this machine to cut out thicker metal and some plastics that are non-engravable or have a low acrylic content and therefore melt when treated with the high heat of a laser engraver.</p>
